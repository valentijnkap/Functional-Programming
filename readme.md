# Functional Programming course

## Short notice

I'm following a course at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. The course is focussed on the use of D3.js and external data. With this course comes some learning goals which I will accomplish by doing an assessment. In the readme, I will describe my progress and what I did to come up with this result. The actual result can be found in the [app](app/) folder.

## My progress

### Intro

I need to be honest... This course is haunting me since day one. This is the third time I'm following this course because I failed the times before. But I do get better at it each time so that's worth something. Well back to the point. I couldn't attend the lectures at school because I'm doing an internship at the moment. To refresh my knowledge about D3 I followed a course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/learn-d3js-for-data-visualization/) instead. This course helped me to understand `scales`, `SVG`, `loading data`, different charts types and using D3 on the server side. I followed almost all section on this course and it helped me a lot. I wrote a couple of [notes](notes/) to help me remind what I learned. My [working log](log.md) is explaining better how I progressed through this online course. As you would understand, a lot of code that has been explained in the online course is being used in my visualization. But I will notice what I reused and what I did myself.

### Making choices

Will write more about that tomorrow.
