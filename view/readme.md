# Data visualization

Here you can find some practical information about the visualization. This webpack setup is based on the example from [Will Soares](https://github.com/willamesoares/learn-d3). The chart that has been made is based on a couple of examples that had been explained at the udemy course [Learn d3js for data visualization](https://www.udemy.com/learn-d3js-for-data-visualization/).
